# Hiding-text-inside-an-Image-using-Steganography
"Explore the fascinating world of steganography with our project, where we delve into the art of concealing text within images. Uncover the secrets of hidden messages and enhance your understanding of this cryptographic technique."

Steganography Project
This Python project demonstrates steganography techniques to hide text within an image using bitwise XOR encryption. Steganography is the practice of concealing secret information within a host image without changing the visual appearance noticeably.

Features
Encryption: Embeds text into an image using a user-provided security key and hides it using bitwise XOR encryption.
Decryption: Retrieves hidden text from an image using the original security key.
User Interaction: Simple command-line interface for inputting the security key and text to be hidden.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
Operating System: Windows (for file handling operations, can be adapted for other platforms)
Usage
Encryption:

Run encryption.py.
Enter the security key and text to hide when prompted.
The program will embed the text into the image and save it as encrypted_img.jpg.
Decryption:

Run decryption.py.
Enter the security key used during encryption.
The program will extract and display the hidden text from encrypted_img.jpg.
Notes
Ensure the security key used during encryption is identical to decrypt successfully.
The project supports hiding text of various lengths and maintains the integrity of the host image.
